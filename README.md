magik-commit
============
[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/magik-commit.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/magik-commit)

Automagically adds the Jira ticket ID to the commit message. A Jira issue ID 
has the following format `JIRA-42`. So it starts with capital letters followed 
by a dash and then a number, for instance `XXX-42`. 

This script parses the ticket ID from the Git branch name from the currently
active branch. Examples of possible branch names, assuming ticket ID is `JIRA-42`.
- JIRA-42
- JIRA-42-description-here
- feature/JIRA-42
- feature/JIRA-42-description-here
- feature-JIRA-42
- feature-JIRA-42-description-here
- feature_JIRA-42
- feature_JIRA-42_description_here

The recommended format is: `feature/JIRA-42-description-here`.

To easily get the Jira Ticket ID in the branch name, use the 'create branch' 
link on the ticket's details page. This link is available after integrating
Bitbucket with Jira. For more information, see the [Bitbucket documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/jira-integration-776639874.html).
